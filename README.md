# Affirm PoC

This is just a test to see how we can send the Blackhawk certificate in a Gatsby function.
For now, the certificate is included in the repo - which we don't want in the future. We will
have to figure out a good way of storing it so we can have one file for the production setup, and
all developers have their own certificates for the sandbox.
